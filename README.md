delete it and paste your address into it. Next what your gonna want to do is save it, (control S dumby) and then go back into the file explorer to run it. Click on it once and it should open a terminal window that is gonna start the miner. Give it a minute to get working and then once it starts to say shares are accepted then you know you set it up correctly. Next thing is, like most miners this doesnt mine directly to the wallet. It mines to a pool. The pool is free for how this is setup. You want to go to
https://nanswap.com/mining/banano and scroll down and enter your banano address into the search bar. once your miner has been running for a bit it will look like this
